## About Us

The Rhabanus-Maurus-Gymnasium St. Ottilien has more to offer than just lessons and homework. In addition to numerous clubs, you can also get involved with the SMV or the school paramedics. There are also several choirs and orchestras for those with musical talent. But we also do not neglect the scientific and technical areas.<br>
We are a group of students and alumni who primarily look after the RMG website. However, we also take on other public relations tasks: During the Corona pandemic, for example, we set up two live streams for new admissions.

## Projects
